Let me briefly explain the meaning of this value: when the number of elements in the HashMap reaches 0.75 times its capacity (i.e., 12 elements when the capacity is 16), the HashMap will be resized to reduce hash collisions and avoid the degradation of HashMap into a linked list, which significantly increases the query time.
